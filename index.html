	<h1>Welcome to Taylor's Website</h1>
	<h2><em>We hope you'll enjoy your stay.</em></h2>
	<p>
	Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
 	Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
	Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
 	Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br>
	Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br>
 	With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
	And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br>
 	Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace<br>
	</p>
	<h3><em>For Micky</em></h3>
	<p>
	<em>our small couch too large<br>
	the heated blanket not warm<br>
	when you are not here</em><br>
