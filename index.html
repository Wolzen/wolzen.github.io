	<strong>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
 	Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br>
	Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
 	Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br>
	Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br>
 	With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br>
	And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br>
 	Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace<br></strong>

	when you are not here</em><br>
