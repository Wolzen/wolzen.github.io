	<h1>Welcome to Taylor's Website</h1>
	<h2><em>We hope you'll enjoy your stay.</em></h2>
	<p>
		Full many a glorious morning have I seen
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
 With ugly rack on his celestial face,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
	</p>
	<h3><em>For Micky</em></h3>

		<em>our small couch too large
the heated blanket not warm
when you are not here</em>
